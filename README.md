# Detect-optics-with-PIR-sensor
Detect optics with PIR sensor project based on AVR(ATmega32) ..using: 
1- MCAl driver (DIO)
2-HAL driver(LCD).  
IR sensor transmit infrared Radiation and reflect it for receiver  if detect any Optics . in this project I used passive IR sensor with out Transmitted signal Considering that there are objects that radiate infrared radiation, such as the human body and the sun.
